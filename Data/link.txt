Metadata: 
Column Description

COVID-19 dataset covid_de.csv:

    state: Name of the German federal state. Germany has 16 federal states. I removed converted special characters from the original data.

    county: The name of the German Landkreis (LK) or Stadtkreis (SK), which correspond roughly to US counties.

    age_group: The COVID-19 data is being reported for 6 age groups: 0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, and above 80 years old. As a shortcut the last category I'm using "80-99", but there might well be persons above 99 years old in this dataset. This column has a few NA entries.

    gender: Reported as male (M) or female (F). This column has a few NA entries.

    date: The calendar date of when a case or death were reported. There might be delays that will be corrected by retroactively assigning cases to earlier dates.

    cases: COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed through laboratory work. This and the following 2 columns are counts per day, not cumulative counts.

    deaths: COVID-19 related deaths.

    recovered: Recovered cases.

Demographic dataset demographics_de.csv:

    state, gender, age_group: same as above. The demographic data is available in higher age resolution, but I have binned it here to match the corresponding age groups in the covid_de.csv file.

    population: Population counts for the respective categories. These numbers reflect the (most recent available) estimates on 2018-12-31.

Vaccination progress dataset covid_de_vaccines.csv:

    date: calendar date of vaccination

    doses, doses_first, doses_second: Daily count of administered doses: total, 1st shot, 2nd shot.

    pfizer_cumul, moderna_cumul, astrazeneca_cumul: Daily cumulative number of administered vaccinations by manufacturer.

    persons_first_cumul, persons_full_cumul: Daily cumulative number of people having received their 1st shot and full vaccination, respectively.
